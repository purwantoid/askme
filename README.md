## Development Workflow

### Development Guidelines
This project follows comprehensive development standards documented in `CLAUDE.md`. Key practices include:

- **Laravel Boost Integration**: All development tasks must use Laravel Boost tools for debugging and enhancement
- **Spec-Driven Development**: New features follow the specification workflow in `.claude/specs/`
- **Code Quality Standards**: Laravel Pint (PHP), ESLint & Prettier (TypeScript/React)
- **Testing Approach**: PHPUnit for backend, feature tests preferred over unit tests

### Project Structure
The codebase follows Laravel 12's streamlined structure with React/TypeScript frontend:

```
app/Http/Controllers/     # Feature controllers
app/Models/              # Eloquent models  
resources/js/pages/      # Inertia page components
resources/js/components/ # Reusable React components
routes/                  # Laravel route definitions
```

See `.claude/steering/structure.md` for complete organization guidelines.

### Development Commands
```bash
# Code formatting
vendor/bin/pint           # Format PHP code
npm run lint             # Lint TypeScript/React
npm run format           # Format with Prettier

# Testing
php artisan test         # Run PHP tests
npm run test            # Run JavaScript tests (if configured)

# Development server
composer run dev        # Full-stack development server
```
